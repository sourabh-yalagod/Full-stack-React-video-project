Vidsphere is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application inspired by YouTube. It allows users to upload, watch, like, and comment on videos. The project showcases my skills in front-end and back-end development, state management, and deployment.

## Features

- **Video Upload and Playback**: Users can upload videos and watch them seamlessly using Video.js for smooth playback.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Implemented infinite scrolling using React Queryâ€™s `useInfiniteQuery` for efficient data loading.
- **State Management**: Utilized Redux and Redux Persist for robust state management across the application.
- **User Authentication**: Integrated JWT-based authentication with cookie management using `js-cookie` and `jwt-decode`.
- **Interactive Features**: Users can like videos, comment, and engage with the platform in a YouTube-like experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Front-end**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, React Query, Redux, Video.js
- **Back-end**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT, js-cookie, jwt-decode
- **Deployment**: Render (separate services for frontend and backend)
